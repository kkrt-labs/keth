# Project Instructions

## Overview
- Keth is an open-source proving backend for the Ethereum Execution Layer built with Kakarot Core EVM and Cairo.
- Purpose: To prove Ethereum state transitions asynchronously by pulling pre-state, executing transactions, and computing post-state.

## Architecture
- Bridges Python and Cairo through three components:
  - Type Generation (`args_gen.py`): Converts Python values to Cairo memory layout
  - Serialization (`serde.py`): Converts values in Cairo memory to Python types
  - Test Runner (`runner.py`): Orchestrates program execution and manages memory segments

- Implements the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in Cairo Zero
  - Core EVM components in `cairo/ethereum/prague/`
  - Type system in `cairo/ethereum_types/`
  - Test framework adapted from Ethereum Execution Specs

## Goals
- Implement a complete EVM in Cairo for provable execution
- Maintain strict compatibility with Ethereum's execution semantics
- Optimize for provability while maintaining readability
- Support the prague fork of Ethereum

## AI Guidance
- For type system questions, focus on both the Cairo implementation and Python bridging, refer to patterns in @common_patterns.mdc
- For generic Cairo questions, refer to @coding_standards.mdc and @common_patterns.mdc
- For EVM logic, refer to the Ethereum execution specs and the Cairo implementation
- When implementing new features, follow the established patterns for error handling, type wrapping, and testing
