"""
Cairo Test System - Runtime and Type Integration

This module handles the execution of Cairo programs and provides the core integration
with the type system for testing. It enables running tests with inputs passed as pure Python by automatically
handling type conversion between Python and Cairo.

The runner works with args_gen.py and serde.py for automatic type conversion.

    Pytest fixture to collect and aggregate coverage across test runs within a module.

    This fixture addresses memory issues associated with collecting coverage for many
    tests within a single module (test file). Instead of accumulating coverage
    DataFrames in memory on each test run, it performs the following steps:
    1. Creates a unique temporary directory for the current worker and test module.
    2. Yields a `_collect_coverage` function to the test runner.
    3. The `_collect_coverage` function calculates coverage for a single test run
       and writes the resulting DataFrame to a unique Parquet file in the temporary
       directory.
    4. After all tests in the module have run, the fixture's teardown logic executes.
    5. It scans all the temporary Parquet files (lazily) using Polars.
    6. It concatenates these lazy frames.
    7. It merges the concatenated coverage data with the base statement information
       for each relevant Cairo file, aggregates the counts, and calculates coverage.
    8. The final aggregated coverage report is written to a JSON file in the
       `coverage/<worker_id>/` directory.
    9. The temporary directory and its Parquet files are deleted.

    This approach significantly reduces peak memory usage during test execution by
    offloading intermediate results to disk, only loading and processing the full
    aggregated data during the final teardown phase of the module.

        request: Pytest request object.
